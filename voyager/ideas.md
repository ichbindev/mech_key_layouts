NEED
maybe better ` in general

mouse layer
back/forward on v nav layer?

hold 6 for =
hold [ for ]

Left thumbs: command, alt, tab, escape, backspace
right thumbs: space, enter, shift, layer?


shifts might be better moving down one row to normal spot
need to make sure hold modifiers are on both sides and can accommodate their tap key when being held

return on left - L2 tab
move num pad somewhere more comfortable
need easier pipe -> hold ;, l2 [
expose/ctrl up -> l2 x
backspace on right side? l1 '
easier ~ -> l1 a
cmd/opt/shift/arrows, 
	l3 -> cmd shift m,./ alt shift neio
cmd + tab -> l3 return
cmd + ` -> l3 space
